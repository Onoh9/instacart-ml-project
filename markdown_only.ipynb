    "\n",

    "3.  `user_avg_basket_size`: Average number of items purchased per prior order. (Indicates typical order size).\n",
    "4.  `user_reorder_ratio`: Overall proportion of items purchased across all prior orders that were reorders. (Indicates tendency to stick to known items vs. explore).\n",

    "    *   **Why Stratify?** As noted before, our target variable is imbalanced (~81.6% class 1, ~18.4% class 0). Stratified splitting ensures both the training and testing sets maintain this same proportion, leading to a more reliable evaluation."

It then transforms this log-odds score into a probability (between 0 and 1). By default, if the probability is >= 0.5, it predicts 1; otherwise, it predicts 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since our data is imbalanced (more 1s than 0s), accuracy alone isn't sufficient. We'll use several metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Accuracy:** Overall percentage of correct predictions. (Can be misleading here since we'd get 81% accuracy from guessing yes on all orders, regardless on if we used a model or not.)\n",
    "*   **Precision (Specificity):** For a specific class (e.g., class 1), answers: \"Of all the times the model predicted this class, how often was it right?\" (High precision means few False Positives).\n",
    "*   **Recall (Sensitivity):** For a specific class, answers: \"Of all the actual instances of this class, how many did the model correctly identify?\" (High recall means few False Negatives).\n",
    "*   **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, providing a single score that balances both. Useful for comparing overall performance per class.\n",
    "*   **AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve):** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between the positive (1) and negative (0) classes across *all* possible probability thresholds. Ranges from 0.5 (random guessing) to 1.0 (perfect separation). This is often a key metric for imbalanced data.\n",
    "*   **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing the counts of:\n",
    "    *   True Positives (Actual 1, Predicted 1)\n",
    "    *   True Negatives (Actual 0, Predicted 0)\n",
    "    *   False Positives (Actual 0, Predicted 1 - Type I error)\n",

    "\n",
    "The evaluation metrics for our baseline Logistic Regression model reveal several important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Overall Discriminatory Power (AUC-ROC = 0.7523):** The AUC score is significantly above 0.5, indicating that the model has a reasonable ability to differentiate between users who will buy a new product versus those who won't. It's performing much better than random chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **High Accuracy, Misleading Picture (Accuracy = 0.8306):** While accuracy seems high, it's heavily influenced by the model correctly predicting the majority class (Class 1: New Product Purchased), which makes up ~81.6% of the data. It doesn't tell the full story about performance on both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Performance on Majority Class (Class 1 - New):**\n",
    "    *   The model achieves high Recall (0.9813) and good Precision (0.8385) for Class 1. This means it correctly identifies almost all users who *do* buy a new product, and when it predicts they will, it's often right. The F1-score (0.9043) reflects this strong performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Performance on Minority Class (Class 0 - No New):**\n",
    "    *   **This is the main weakness.** The Recall for Class 0 is very low (0.16). This means the model only successfully identifies 16% of the users who *did not* buy a new product. It misses the vast majority (84%) of this group.\n",
    "    *   The Precision for Class 0 (0.67) is better, meaning when it *does* predict Class 0, it's correct about two-thirds of the time. However, it makes this prediction very rarely due to the low recall.\n",
    "    *   The resulting F1-score (0.26) is poor, highlighting the model's difficulty with this minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Key Feature Insights (Coefficients):**\n",
    "    *   The model heavily relies on `user_reorder_ratio` (coefficient -4.05). A higher historical reorder rate strongly predicts *against* buying a new product. This aligns perfectly with intuition.\n",
    "    *   `user_avg_basket_size` has a moderate positive influence (coefficient 0.13), suggesting larger average orders are slightly associated with buying new products.\n",
    "    *   The other features (`user_avg_days_since_prior`, `user_total_orders`) have a much smaller linear influence according to this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion for Baseline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression model provides a useful, interpretable baseline. It confirms the importance of historical reordering behavior. However, its practical value might be limited by its inability to effectively identify the smaller group of customers who stick only to familiar products (low recall for Class 0). This suggests room for improvement, potentially using models better suited to handling imbalance or capturing more complex relationships."

    "\n",
    "1.  **Try More Complex Models:** Algorithms like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost** might capture more complex patterns and interactions between features that Logistic Regression misses. They also have built-in mechanisms (like `class_weight` or `scale_pos_weight`) that could potentially handle the class imbalance more effectively and improve recall for the minority class.\n",
    "2.  **More Feature Engineering:** Our current model only uses 4 basic features. Creating more features (e.g., related to purchase timing, category preferences, user tenure, characteristics of the *last* order) could provide the model with richer information and improve predictive power.\n",
    "3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The models (including Logistic Regression) have settings (hyperparameters) that we left at their defaults. Systematically testing different settings (e.g., using GridSearchCV) could optimize performance for our specific dataset and evaluation metric (like AUC or F1-score for Class 0).\n",
    "4.  **Address Imbalance Differently:** Explore techniques like resampling (e.g., SMOTE to oversample the minority class or random undersampling of the majority class) during training, although careful evaluation is needed.\n",
    "5.  **Interpretability vs. Performance:** Decide if the slightly lower interpretability of tree-based models (like RF/XGBoost) compared to Logistic Regression coefficients is an acceptable trade-off for potentially higher performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project's current scope, evaluating a more complex model like Random Forest or XGBoost (Option 1) would be a logical next step to see if we can improve upon this baseline, particularly for the minority class prediction."

    "### Trying a More Complex Model: Random Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "Our baseline Logistic Regression model showed decent overall performance (AUC ~0.75) but struggled to identify the minority class (users *not* buying new products). Logistic Regression assumes linear relationships between features and the outcome's probability. Real-world behavior is often more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "To potentially capture non-linear patterns and interactions between our features, we'll now try a **Random Forest Classifier**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Random Forest?**\n",
    "*   **Handles Non-Linearity:** It builds multiple decision trees, which can naturally model non-linear relationships (e.g., the effect of basket size might plateau).\n",
    "*   **Captures Interactions:** By design, it considers how different features work together when making splits in the trees.\n",
    "*   **Robustness:** Generally less sensitive to feature scaling and outliers compared to linear models.\n",
    "*   **Imbalance Handling:** Includes options like `class_weight='balanced'` which explicitly tells the model to pay more attention to the minority class during training, potentially improving its recall.\n",

    "We will train it on the same data and evaluate using the same metrics to directly compare its performance to the Logistic Regression baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Note on Class Imbalance and `class_weight`\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at our target variable distribution (Phase 2), we saw significant **class imbalance**:\n",

    "*   Class 1 (Bought New Product): ~81.6%\n",
    "*   Class 0 (Did Not Buy New Product): ~18.4%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this important?** Standard machine learning algorithms often aim to minimize the overall number of mistakes. With imbalanced data, a model can achieve high *overall accuracy* simply by mostly predicting the majority class (Class 1 in our case). This can result in a model that is poor at identifying the minority class (Class 0), which might be the group we are particularly interested in understanding or targeting differently. Our Logistic Regression results showed this exact issue (very low Recall for Class 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**How `class_weight` Helps:**\n",
    "The `class_weight` parameter, available in many Scikit-learn models like `RandomForestClassifier`, allows us to address this. It adjusts how much the model gets \"penalized\" for making mistakes on different classes during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`class_weight='balanced'`:** We will use this setting. It automatically assigns higher weights to the minority class (Class 0) and lower weights to the majority class (Class 1). The weights are inversely proportional to how frequent each class is.\n",
    "*   **Effect:** This tells the algorithm: \"Pay more attention to getting the Class 0 predictions correct, even if it means making slightly more errors on the common Class 1.\" This often helps to **improve the model's ability to identify the minority class (increasing Recall for Class 0)**, potentially at the cost of slightly lower overall accuracy or precision.\n",

    "2.  **Overall Performance Decline:** This improvement came at a cost. The **AUC dropped significantly** (from 0.7523 to 0.7031), indicating the model's overall ability to distinguish between the classes worsened. Accuracy and performance on the majority class (Class 1) also slightly decreased.\n",
    "3.  **Feature Usage:** Random Forest seems to distribute importance more evenly across the top features (`user_reorder_ratio`, `user_avg_basket_size`, `user_avg_days_since_prior`) compared to Logistic Regression, suggesting it leverages them differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision & Path Forward:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While Random Forest addressed the specific goal of improving minority class recall, the drop in overall discriminatory power (AUC) is concerning. It suggests that simply applying a standard non-linear model with basic class weighting wasn't sufficient with our current features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary paths forward:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Path A: Try a Different Algorithm:** Explore another powerful algorithm like **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**. XGBoost often achieves state-of-the-art results on tabular data and handles feature interactions and non-linearities differently than Random Forest. It also has robust mechanisms for handling class imbalance (`scale_pos_weight`). We can see if it offers a better balance between overall performance (AUC) and minority class identification.\n",
    "*   **Path B: More Feature Engineering:** Acknowledge that our current 4 features might be too simple. We could pause modeling and engineer more descriptive features (related to timing, categories, user tenure, etc.) hoping to provide *any* model with more signal to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Chosen Next Step: Try XGBoost (Path A)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will proceed with **Path A** for now and evaluate XGBoost. It represents a different type of gradient-boosted ensemble model and is worth testing before concluding that our features are insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Rationale:** It's valuable to see if a different algorithmic approach can better utilize the existing features.\n",
    "*   **Contingency:** If XGBoost *also* fails to significantly improve upon the Logistic Regression baseline (especially in AUC), it will strengthen the argument for needing **more feature engineering (Path B)** as the most critical next step.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Minority Class Identification:** XGBoost achieved **by far the highest Recall (0.64) and F1-Score (0.45) for Class 0 (No New Product)**. Using `scale_pos_weight` was very effective in forcing the model to identify a majority (64%) of these difficult-to-find users.\n",
    "2.  **Trade-off:** This came at the cost of significantly lower Recall (0.7280) for the majority Class 1 compared to the other models. Precision for Class 0 was also the lowest (0.35), meaning many of its Class 0 predictions were incorrect (False Positives). Overall accuracy (0.7123) was the lowest due to the shift in focus towards Class 0.\n",
    "3.  **AUC Performance:** XGBoost's AUC (0.7483) is very close to Logistic Regression's (0.7523) and much better than Random Forest's (0.7031). This suggests its overall ability to rank users correctly is competitive with the baseline linear model, despite its very different internal mechanics and class performance balance.\n",
    "4.  **Feature Importance:** Similar to the other models, `user_reorder_ratio` and `user_avg_basket_size` are overwhelmingly the most important features. XGBoost relies even more heavily on these top two compared to Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Comparison & Path Forward:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **No Single Best:** None of the models is universally superior across all metrics.\n",
    "    *   **Logistic Regression:** Offers the best AUC (slightly) and balanced performance *for the majority class*. It's simple and interpretable but fails on minority recall.\n",
    "    *   **Random Forest:** In this configuration, it underperformed on AUC and didn't offer compelling advantages.\n",
    "    *   **XGBoost:** Provides the best performance by far on the **minority class (Recall 0, F1 0)**, making it potentially valuable if identifying users who *don't* try new things is a key goal. Its AUC is competitive with Logistic Regression.\n",
    "*   **The Feature Ceiling:** The fact that neither RF nor XGBoost significantly surpassed the baseline Logistic Regression's AUC, despite their ability to model complexity, **strongly suggests that we may be limited by our current set of 4 features.** They might not contain enough predictive signal to push performance much higher, regardless of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision & Recommended Next Step:**\n",

    "Given these findings, the most promising path to achieving a potentially *significant* improvement and building a more impressive project is likely **Phase 3b: More Feature Engineering**.\n",

    "2.  **Highlighting the Model Trade-off:** Emphasize the persistent choice between Logistic Regression (better AUC/overall accuracy) and XGBoost (much better minority class identification). The \"best\" model depends on the specific business goal (is it more important to find *everyone* likely to buy new, or specifically identify those who *won't*?).\n",
    "3.  **Proposing Next Steps:** Logically, **Hyperparameter Tuning (Option B)** for XGBoost (and potentially LR) seems like the most direct next step *within the modeling phase*.

    "1.  **Hyperparameter Tuning (Highest Priority):**\n",
    "    *   **Focus:** Primarily on XGBoost, as it showed the most potential for handling the minority class effectively. Tuning parameters like `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `learning_rate`, `gamma`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree` could significantly improve its AUC and potentially find an even better balance.\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  **Threshold Adjustment:** For the chosen *best* model (after tuning), analyze its probability outputs (`predict_proba`) and potentially select a probability threshold different from the default 0.5 to optimize for a specific balance of Precision and Recall based on business needs (e.g., using a Precision-Recall curve).\n",

    "## Project Recap & Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully executed an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict if an Instacart user would purchase a new product in their next order:\n",
    "1.  **Goal & Data:** Defined the prediction task using Instacart data and established 'new product purchase' as a proxy for marketing success/user exploration.\n",
    "2.  **Target Variable:** Calculated the binary target `new_product_purchased`.\n",
    "3.  **Feature Engineering:** Created an initial set of 4 user-level features and later expanded to 13 features capturing timing, diversity, and reorder patterns based on prior purchase history.\n",
    "4.  **Modeling & Evaluation:**\n",
    "    *   Built a Logistic Regression baseline.\n",
    "    *   Tested Random Forest, observing trade-offs with class weighting.\n",
    "    *   Evaluated XGBoost, noting its effectiveness (with `scale_pos_weight`) in identifying the minority class.\n",
    "    *   Retrained models with expanded features, finding modest gains for LR but limited impact on XGBoost defaults.\n",
    "5.  **Optimization:** Performed hyperparameter tuning on XGBoost using `RandomizedSearchCV`, resulting in the best overall performance achieved in this project (AUC = 0.7605, Class 0 Recall = 0.66).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings & Model Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Best Model:** The **tuned XGBoost model** emerged as the strongest performer, offering the best balance found between overall discriminatory power (highest AUC achieved) and significantly improved identification of the minority class (highest Recall and F1 for Class 0).\n",
    "*   **Feature Importance:** Across models, `user_reorder_ratio` and `user_avg_basket_size` consistently proved to be the most influential predictors.\n",
    "*   **Challenge:** Accurately predicting new product purchases, especially identifying the ~18% of users who *don't* buy new items, remains challenging even with optimization, suggesting potential limits to the current feature set or requiring more advanced techniques.\n",
    "*   **Trade-offs:** A clear trade-off exists between models optimized for overall AUC/accuracy (like LR) and those optimized for minority class recall (like tuned XGBoost). The choice depends on the specific business objective.\n",

    "## Future Directions & \"Part B\"\n",

    "While this concludes the core demonstration of building a user-level prediction model, several exciting avenues exist for future work:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refining the Current Model:**\n",
    "1.  **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Develop more sophisticated features (time-decayed, category-based, lag features, interaction terms) to potentially break through the current performance ceiling.\n",
    "2.  **More Tuning/Other Models:** Conduct more extensive hyperparameter searches or explore other algorithms (e.g., LightGBM, Neural Networks) if features alone aren't sufficient.\n",
    "3.  **Threshold Optimization:** Fine-tune the probability threshold of the final model based on specific precision/recall goals for deployment.\n",
    "4.  **Error Analysis:** Deeply analyze the samples the best model misclassifies to guide further improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"Part B\" - Product-Level Prediction:**\n",
    "5.  **Reformulate the Problem:** Shift from predicting if a *user* buys *any* new product to predicting the probability that a *specific user* buys a *specific new product*.\n",
    "    *   **Requires:** User-product level training data, new features describing product characteristics and user-product interactions, and different model evaluation strategies.\n",
    "    *   **Benefit:** Enables highly targeted recommendations or promotions for individual products a user hasn't tried before.\n",

    "# Phase 9 (Revised): Refining the Best Model - Threshold Adjustment for Class 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Our tuned XGBoost model showed the best potential for identifying the minority class (Class 0 - No New Product), achieving a Recall of 0.66 with the default 0.5 probability threshold. However, this default threshold might not yield the optimal balance of Precision and Recall *specifically for Class 0*.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We recalculated performance across different probability thresholds, this time specifically aiming to maximize the **F1-Score for the minority Class 0 (No New Product)** using our tuned XGBoost model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Optimal Threshold for Class 0 F1 (0.4540):** The threshold that best balances Precision and Recall *for Class 0* was found to be 0.4540. This is significantly higher than the threshold that optimized F1 for Class 1 (0.1734) and slightly lower than the default 0.5.\n",
    "2.  **Class 0 Performance at Optimal Threshold:**\n",
    "    *   **F1-Score (Class 0):** Achieved the maximum value found of **0.47 (0.4676)**. This is slightly better than the F1-score achieved using the default 0.5 threshold (0.46 from the previous report) and much better than the F1 achieved when optimizing for Class 1 (0.27).\n",
    "    *   **Recall (Class 0):** Reached **0.60**. This is lower than the recall achieved with the default 0.5 threshold (0.66) but vastly better than optimizing for Class 1 (0.16). We are still identifying a good portion (60%) of users who don't buy new products.\n",
    "    *   **Precision (Class 0):** Improved to **0.38** compared to the default threshold (0.36). When the model predicts Class 0 using this threshold, it's correct 38% of the time.\n",
    "3.  **Impact on Class 1 Performance:** As expected, optimizing for Class 0 slightly impacts Class 1:\n",
    "    *   Recall (Class 1) decreased to 0.7796 (compared to 0.9826 when optimizing for Class 1 F1).\n",
    "    *   Precision (Class 1) remained high at 0.8966.\n",
    "    *   F1-Score (Class 1) decreased to 0.8340.\n",
    "4.  **Overall Metrics:**\n",
    "    *   Accuracy (0.7469) is higher than with the default 0.5 threshold (0.7169) but lower than when optimizing for Class 1 F1 (0.8318).\n",
    "    *   AUC remains unchanged (0.7605), as it's threshold-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing the threshold specifically to maximize the F1-score for Class 0 yields a threshold of **0.4540**. This operating point provides the best balance found *between Precision and Recall for the minority class*, achieving an F1-score of 0.47 and identifying 60% of these users (Recall=0.60).\n",
    "\n",
    "This contrasts with:\n",
    "*   The **default 0.5 threshold**, which gave slightly higher Recall (0.66) but lower Precision (0.36) and F1 (0.46) for Class 0.\n",
    "*   The **Class 1 F1-optimized threshold (0.1734)**, which completely sacrificed Class 0 Recall (0.16) for maximizing Class 1 performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing the Right Threshold:** The choice between the default 0.5 threshold and this optimized 0.4540 threshold depends on whether the priority for Class 0 is slightly higher *recall* (finding more, even with more false positives - use default 0.5) or the best *balance* of precision and recall (use 0.4540). Both are significant improvements over the initial Logistic Regression model for identifying this group. It really depends on the business application! Which type of error is more costly? Missing a user who won't buy new (FN for Class 0)? Or wrongly predicting a user won't buy new when they will (FP for Class 0)?\n",

    "    *   *In short:* They *look* more like typical explorers (lower reorder ratio, higher diversity, larger baskets) based on averages, but in their *specific* 'train' order, they happened to only buy familiar items. The model was \"fooled\" by their generally exploratory profile.\n",

Features describing the *most recent* orders (e.g., size of the very last basket, time since *that* order, was the *last* order unusually large/small?) might help capture deviations from the average that predict behavior in the *next* order.\n",

    "**Analysis of Final Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Feature Engineering Impact:** Adding the final two recency features (`days_since_last_order`, `last_order_basket_size`) provided another boost to performance for *both* models.\n",
    "    *   **Logistic Regression:** AUC improved further to **0.7676** (from 0.7580). Recall for Class 0 also slightly increased to **0.19**.\n",
    "    *   **Tuned XGBoost:** AUC saw a more significant jump to **0.7803** (from 0.7605). Crucially, **Recall for Class 0 reached 0.70** (up from 0.66), and the F1-score for Class 0 improved to **0.48**. Precision for Class 1 also hit a high of **0.9131**.\n",
    "2.  **Final Model Champion:** The **Tuned XGBoost model trained on the final 15 features** is clearly the best-performing model developed in this project. It achieves the highest AUC (0.7803) and provides by far the best capability for identifying the minority class (Recall 0 = 0.70, F1 0 = 0.48), while maintaining very high precision for the majority class (Precision 1 = 0.91).\n",
    "3.  **New Feature Importance (XGBoost):** The final XGBoost feature importance plot shows that the new recency feature `last_order_basket_size` became the *most important* feature, surpassing even `user_reorder_ratio` and `user_avg_basket_size`. `days_since_last_order` also showed reasonable importance. This confirms that information about the *immediately preceding* order is highly valuable for predicting behavior in the *next* order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Project Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a structured process involving data exploration, clear target definition, iterative feature engineering (culminating in 15 user-level features including recency), baseline modeling, evaluation of advanced algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning, we successfully built an XGBoost model capable of predicting whether an Instacart user will purchase a new product in their next order with reasonable accuracy (AUC = 0.7803).\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model demonstrates a strong ability to identify the challenging minority group (users *not* buying new products, Recall=0.70) while maintaining high precision when predicting the majority group (Precision=0.91). Key drivers identified include the user's historical reorder ratio, average basket size, and particularly the size of their last order.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project serves as a practical demonstration of the machine learning workflow, highlighting the importance of feature engineering, model selection trade-offs (especially with imbalanced data), and optimization techniques like hyperparameter tuning and threshold analysis to arrive at a useful predictive model. Potential future work could involve even more advanced features or exploring the \"Part B\" task of predicting specific product purchases."
